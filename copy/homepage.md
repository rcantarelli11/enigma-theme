## Brand Story Section
**Headline:** Why Enigma?
**Body:** Most supplement brands sell you a label. We sell you what's on it. Every Enigma product is transparent, third-party tested, and built for people who read the ingredients list before the marketing copy. We started Enigma because we were tired of overpaying for underdosed products wrapped in loud packaging. No neon. No bro science. Just clean nutrition that works.
