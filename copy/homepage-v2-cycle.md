# Enigma — Homepage V2: The Cycle

## Concept
The entire brand repositions around "The Enigma Cycle" — a complete performance system, not individual supplements. The homepage tells this story through an interactive, animated cycle visualization.

## The Cycle — Interactive Section

**Section Headline:** Your Body Runs in Cycles. Your Nutrition Should Too.

**Intro paragraph:** Most brands sell you a product. We built a system. The Enigma Cycle covers every phase of your training day — energy, endurance, recovery, strength, and rest. Each product is designed to work alone, but they're engineered to work together.

### Phase 1: ENERGY
**Time:** Pre-Training | 15-20 min before
**Product:** Energy Powder (Pre Workout)
**Copy:** Dial in before you start. Clean energy, smooth focus, zero crash. Every ingredient on the label — because you should know what's fueling your session.
**Transition:** You're locked in. Now sustain it. →

### Phase 2: HYDRATION
**Time:** During Training
**Product:** Hydration Powder
**Copy:** Water isn't enough when you're pushing hard. Full electrolyte profile — sodium, potassium, magnesium — in the ratios your body actually needs. Not a sugar bomb with electrolyte marketing.
**Transition:** Session complete. Time to rebuild. →

### Phase 3: PROTEIN
**Time:** Post-Training | Within 30 min
**Product:** Advanced 100% Whey Protein Isolate
**Copy:** 25g of pure whey isolate. Fast-absorbing, easy on the stomach, no bloating. Recovery starts the moment you finish. Make it count.
**Transition:** Muscles fed. Now strengthen the foundation. →

### Phase 4: STRENGTH
**Time:** Daily
**Product:** Creatine Monohydrate
**Copy:** The most studied supplement in fitness. 5g pure creatine, properly dosed, no filler. Strength, power output, and recovery — the fundamentals, done right.
**Transition:** Your body is building. Let it rest. →

### Phase 5: REST
**Time:** Evening / Daily
**Product:** Ashwagandha
**Copy:** Training breaks you down. Sleep builds you up. Ashwagandha manages cortisol, supports recovery, and promotes the deep rest your body needs to actually grow. The phase most athletes skip — and shouldn't.
**Transition:** Recovered. Recharged. Ready to go again. → [loops back to Phase 1]

## Design Notes for Bolt

### Typography
- Headlines: Serif (Cormorant Garamond or Instrument Serif) — editorial, confident
- Body: Clean sans-serif (Inter or similar) — readable, modern
- Phase labels: All caps, tracked out, small — like a luxury watch catalog

### Color
- Background: Deep black/charcoal (#0a0a0a or #111111)
- Text: Off-white (#f5f5f5) — not pure white
- Accent: Enigma teal — ONLY on primary CTAs, cycle nodes, and phase transitions
- Secondary: Subtle gray for borders/dividers

### Animation
- Cycle visualization: SVG-based, smooth CSS/JS animation. Each node pulses teal in sequence
- Scroll-triggered: Each phase section reveals on scroll with subtle fade-up
- Bundle builder: Smooth flavor selection with visual feedback
- Keep it fast — no heavy libraries, no jank

### Layout
- Full-width sections, generous vertical spacing (120px+ between sections)
- Product images: Large, centered, dark background, shot from slightly above
- Max content width: 1200px centered
- Mobile: Cycle becomes vertical timeline, same content

### What NOT to do
- No gradients (except subtle glow on teal accents)
- No stock photo lifestyle images
- No cluttered grids
- No "SALE" or "LIMITED TIME" energy
- No bright colors competing with teal
