## Hero
**Eyebrow:** OUR STORY
**Headline:** We Got Tired of Reading Labels and Finding Lies.
**Sub:** So we made a supplement brand where every ingredient earns its place and every dose is on the label.

---

## Section 1: The Problem

**Headline:** The Supplement Industry Has a Transparency Problem.

Proprietary blends. Underdosed ingredients. $60 tubs with $8 worth of powder inside. Celebrity endorsements from people who've never opened the product.

You've seen it. You've probably bought it. We did too.

The worst part? You can't even check. "Proprietary blend" is a legal way to hide what's actually in the formula. It could be 90% filler and 10% active ingredient. You'd never know.

That's not premium. That's a scam with better packaging.

## Section 2: The Fix

**Headline:** Full Label. Every Product. No Exceptions.

Every Enigma product has a fully transparent label. Every ingredient, every dose — printed right there. Not because regulators forced us to. Because we built formulas worth showing.

When your creatine is actually 5g per serving, you don't need to hide behind a blend. When your pre-workout has clinically effective doses, you don't need proprietary mystique. You just put it on the label.

## Section 3: The System

**Headline:** Not Products. A System.

Most brands sell you a tub. We built a cycle.

Five phases that cover your entire training day — energy, hydration, recovery, strength, rest. Each product works alone. But they're engineered to work together.

The Enigma Cycle isn't a bundle discount gimmick. It's how nutrition actually works: your body doesn't stop needing support after your last rep. Pre-training. During. Post. Daily. Recovery. That's the cycle. That's the system.

## Section 4: Who It's For

**Headline:** Built for People Who Show Up.

Not influencers. Not sponsored athletes with perfect lighting and curated stacks.

Real people who train 4-5 days a week. Who meal prep on Sundays. Who actually read the back of the label before they buy. Who want their supplements to match the discipline they bring to everything else.

If that's you, you're in the right place.

## Values Strip (3 columns)

**Transparency**
Full label on every product. Every ingredient, every dose. No proprietary blends. No "other ingredients" that need a chemistry degree to decode.

**Effective Doses**
Clinical doses of what works. Not fairy-dust amounts of trendy ingredients. If the research says 5g, we put 5g. Not 2g with a bigger font.

**Fair Price**
Premium means better product, not bigger markup. We cut the influencer budgets and the flashy packaging. You get better ingredients at a price that respects your wallet.
