## Energy Powder (Pre Workout) — $29
**7 flavors:** Cotton Candy · Fruit Punch · Guava Berry · Lychee Splash · Melon Creamsicle · Strawberry Shortcake · Yuzu

**Tagline:** Know what's fueling your session.

**Short description:**
Clean pre-workout. Smooth focus, sustained energy, no crash. Every ingredient and every dose printed on the label — not hidden behind a proprietary blend.

**Key points:**
- Full label transparency — zero proprietary blends
- Sustained energy without jitters or crashes
- Smooth focus that lasts through your entire session
- 7 flavors you'd actually look forward to drinking
- Mix in 8-10oz cold water, 15-20 min before training

**Long copy (PDP):**
Most pre-workouts hide behind "proprietary blend" on the label. Translation: they don't want you to know how little of each ingredient is actually in there.

We don't do that. Every ingredient, every dose — right there. You know exactly what you're taking. That's the minimum. The fact that it's noteworthy says a lot about this industry.

Clean energy. Smooth focus. Zero crash. Take it 15-20 minutes before your session and feel the difference between real formulation and marketing hype.

## Hydration Powder — $27
**5 flavors:** Lemonade · Lychee · Matcha Green Tea · Passion Fruit · Peach Mango

**Tagline:** Water isn't enough.

**Short description:**
Full electrolyte profile — sodium, potassium, magnesium — in the ratios your body needs when you're pushing hard. Not a sugar bomb with electrolyte branding.

**Key points:**
- Complete electrolyte formula, not just sodium
- Functional hydration for during and after training
- Low sugar — performance fuel, not candy water
- Flavors that stand out: Matcha Green Tea, Passion Fruit, Lychee
- Sip throughout your session for sustained performance

**Long copy (PDP):**
Water handles the basics. But when you're sweating through a hard session, you're losing more than water — you're losing sodium, potassium, magnesium. The minerals your muscles need to keep firing.

Most hydration products dump sugar and call it electrolytes. Ours delivers the actual minerals in the ratios that matter, with flavors you won't get tired of. Lychee. Matcha Green Tea. Passion Fruit. Not your standard "fruit punch" energy.

Sip it during training. Your second half will feel like your first.

## Advanced 100% Whey Protein Isolate — $44
**2 flavors:** Chocolate · Vanilla

**Tagline:** Recovery starts the moment you finish.

**Short description:**
25g pure whey isolate per serving. Fast-absorbing, easy on the stomach, zero bloating. Not a concentrate blend pretending to be isolate.

**Key points:**
- 100% whey protein isolate — not a whey concentrate blend
- 25g protein per serving, minimal lactose
- Low sugar, low fat — lean macros
- Smooth mixability, no clumps, no chalky aftertaste
- Take within 30 minutes post-training for optimal recovery

**Long copy (PDP):**
Flip over most "whey isolate" tubs and you'll find whey concentrate listed first. That's cheaper protein with more lactose, more fat, and slower absorption — dressed up with an isolate label.

Ours is 100% whey protein isolate. Period. 25g per serving, fast-absorbing, easy on your stomach. No bloating, no clumps, no chalky aftertaste. Just clean protein that does what protein is supposed to do.

The 30-minute post-training window matters. Make it count.

## Creatine Monohydrate — $26
**Unflavored**

**Tagline:** The most studied supplement in fitness. Done right.

**Short description:**
5g pure creatine monohydrate per serving. Micronized for absorption. No additives, no flavoring, no markup for fancy branding. Just the fundamentals.

**Key points:**
- 5g creatine monohydrate per serving — clinically effective dose
- Micronized for better absorption and mixability
- Unflavored — stack with anything
- Supports strength, power output, and muscle recovery
- 30 servings per container

**Long copy (PDP):**
Creatine works. The science is settled — decades of research, thousands of studies. It's the one supplement that consistently delivers on strength, power output, and recovery.

So why do some brands charge $50+ for it with added ingredients you didn't ask for?

5g of pure, micronized creatine monohydrate. Properly dosed. No filler. No flavor. No marketing upcharge. Stack it with your protein, your hydration, or just water. It doesn't need to taste like candy to work.

## Ashwagandha — $19
**Natural Extract (KSM-66®)**

**Tagline:** The phase most athletes skip.

**Short description:**
KSM-66® Ashwagandha — the gold standard extract for cortisol management, stress reduction, and recovery support. Training breaks you down. This helps you rebuild.

**Key points:**
- KSM-66® Ashwagandha — highest-concentration full-spectrum extract
- Clinically studied for cortisol reduction
- Supports sleep quality and stress management
- Take daily for cumulative benefits — consistency matters
- The recovery piece most training programs miss

**Long copy (PDP):**
You train hard. You eat right. You take your protein. But are you actually recovering?

Cortisol — the stress hormone — spikes during intense training. If you're not managing it, you're undermining your own work. Elevated cortisol means worse sleep, slower recovery, and less muscle growth. You're working harder for less.

Ashwagandha is the most clinically studied adaptogen for cortisol management. We use KSM-66® — the gold standard full-spectrum extract, backed by over 20 clinical trials. Take it daily. Sleep deeper. Recover faster. Come back stronger.

This is the phase most athletes skip. Don't.

## Copy Guidelines for All PDPs

**Tone:** Direct, confident, slightly contrarian. We're the brand that calls out industry BS without being preachy about it. Think "smart friend who actually reads labels" not "supplement bro" or "wellness influencer."

**Structure for every PDP:**
1. Product image (dark bg, cinematic)
2. Product name + price
3. Flavor selector (if applicable)
4. Short description (2-3 lines)
5. Key points (5 bullets max)
6. "Add to Cart" CTA
7. Long copy section (expandable or below fold)
8. "Complete Your Cycle" cross-sell — show the other 4 products with "Add to Cycle" option
9. Supplement facts panel (image or table)
10. Trust badges: Lab Tested · Full Transparency · Free Shipping over $70

**Cross-sell logic:** Every PDP should push toward the full cycle bundle. "This product is Phase X of 5. Get all 5 and save 20%."
