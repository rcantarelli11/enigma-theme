## Hero
- **Headline:** We Don't Sell Hype. We Sell What Works.
- **Sub:** Enigma is premium fitness nutrition — transparent, effective, and built for people who actually read the label.

## Story
Every supplement brand screams the loudest, slaps a celebrity on the label, and hopes you don't flip the bottle around. Proprietary blends. Underdosed ingredients. $60 tubs of marketing.

We wanted something different. Something honest.

Enigma was built on a simple idea: if the product is good, you don't need to hide what's in it. Every formula is fully transparent — every ingredient, every dose, right on the label. No fillers. No blends. No games.

## Values (3 columns)
- **Transparency:** Full label disclosure. No proprietary blends. You see exactly what you're putting in your body.
- **Quality:** Clean ingredients from trusted suppliers. Every batch tested. No shortcuts.
- **Honesty:** We don't make claims we can't back up. No miracle promises. Just effective nutrition.
