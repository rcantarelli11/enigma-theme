# DTC E-Commerce Conversion Playbook

## Design Principles for High-Converting DTC

### 1. Light > Dark for Trust
- **Dark hero with light body** is the sweet spot — cinematic hero, trustworthy product sections
- Pure black (#000) feels cheap. Warm darks (#1a1a1a, #111) or cream/warm white (#FAFAF7, #F5F3EF) feel premium
- Supplement/health brands especially: light backgrounds = clean, medical, trustworthy. Dark everywhere = "bro supplement" energy
- Best-in-class examples: AG1 (light, clean), Ritual (minimal, warm), Aesop (warm neutrals), Momentous (light with warm accents)

### 2. Product Photography is Everything
- Products on white bg = e-commerce standard, but boring
- Products on lifestyle bg = aspirational, emotional
- Products with ingredient callouts = educational, trust-building
- **Minimum for launch:** clean product shots, transparent labels, supplement facts visible
- **Goal:** lifestyle + product + ingredient flat-lays

### 3. Above-the-Fold Conversion Elements
Every product page and landing page needs within the first viewport:
- Clear headline (benefit, not feature)
- Product image or hero visual
- Price (visible, not hidden behind clicks)
- Primary CTA button
- One trust signal (reviews, "lab tested," free shipping)

### 4. Social Proof Architecture
Layer social proof throughout, not just one section:
- **Hero:** "Trusted by X customers" or star rating
- **Product cards:** review count + stars
- **Below fold:** testimonial carousel
- **Near CTA:** "X sold this week" or "Y people viewing"
- **Checkout:** trust badges, guarantee badge

## Supplement-Specific Conversion Patterns

### The Bundle Builder (Enigma's "Build Your Cycle")
**Structure that converts:**
1. **Story first** — explain WHY a system/bundle matters (education)
2. **Visual builder** — each product as a step/phase with flavor/variant selection
3. **Running total visible** — show savings vs buying individually
4. **Urgency/social proof** — "X bundles built today"
5. **Single CTA** — one "Add Bundle to Cart" button, not 5 individual ATCs

**Bundle pricing psychology:**
- Show retail price crossed out → bundle price
- Calculate and display per-serving or per-day cost
- "Save X%" badge prominent
- Default to bundle selected (not individual products)

### Product Detail Pages (PDPs)
**Structure:**
1. Image gallery (3-5 images: product, label, ingredients, lifestyle, size reference)
2. Product name + tagline
3. Star rating + review count
4. Price (subscription toggle if applicable)
5. Variant/flavor selector
6. Quantity selector
7. **Add to Cart** (primary CTA, high contrast)
8. Trust badges row (lab tested, free shipping, guarantee)
9. Supplement facts (expandable or tab)
10. Benefits/key ingredients section
11. "Complete your routine" cross-sell
12. Reviews section
13. FAQ accordion

### Navigation That Sells
- **Goal-based collections** over product-type collections
  - "Energy & Focus" > "Pre-Workouts"
  - "Recovery" > "Protein Powders"
  - "The Full Cycle" (bundle) as primary nav item
- **Sticky ATC on mobile** — always visible add-to-cart bar on product pages
- **Cart drawer** (slide-out), not cart page — reduces friction
- **Announcement bar:** Free shipping threshold, bundle savings, or limited offer

### Mobile-First Rules (65%+ of supplement traffic is mobile)
- Sticky bottom ATC bar on PDPs
- Thumb-friendly flavor/variant selectors (44px+ touch targets)
- Accordion for supplement facts (not massive table)
- Summary bar for bundle builder (not full sidebar)
- Image carousel with swipe, not zoom-on-tap
- Fast. Under 3 second load. Every second costs ~7% conversion.

## Color Palettes That Convert

### Premium Supplement (Enigma-style)
- Hero: Dark (#111 or #1A1A2E) with accent color
- Body sections: Warm white (#FAFAF7) or light cream (#F5F3EF)
- Accent: One signature color (teal, emerald, gold) — used sparingly on CTAs and highlights
- Text: Near-black (#1a1a1a) on light, off-white (#f0f0f0) on dark
- Cards: White with subtle shadow on light bg, dark glass on dark bg

### Trust Colors
- Green = natural, clean, go/positive
- Blue = trust, clinical, scientific
- Gold/amber = premium, quality
- Red = only for urgency/sale (use sparingly)
- Avoid: neon, gradients, rainbow — screams "cheap supplement"
