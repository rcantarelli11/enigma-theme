## SECTION 2: The Enigma Cycle — Scroll Experience

### Pillar 1: ⚡ ENERGY
**Kicker:** Phase 01 — Ignite

**Headline:**
That "let's go" feeling.
Bottled.

**Body:**
You know the vibe — you show up, you're ready, everything clicks. That's not random. That's your pre workout actually doing its job.

Ours has citrulline, beta-alanine, and caffeine at the doses that research says actually work. Not a mystery blend. Not a heart-attack-in-a-scoop. Just clean energy that hits right.

**Stats:** 6g Citrulline · 3.2g Beta-Alanine · 200mg Caffeine
*Scribble circle around "200mg" with hand-drawn annotation: "the sweet spot"*

### Pillar 2: 💧 HYDRATION
**Kicker:** Phase 02 — Sustain

**Headline:**
Water is great.
It's just not enough.

**Body:**
Halfway through your workout (or honestly, just a hot Tuesday), your body is burning through electrolytes way faster than water alone can fix. That's when things get crampy and sad.

Our hydration powder has the full electrolyte lineup — sodium, potassium, magnesium — and it actually tastes good. Zero sugar. Mix it, drink it, feel the difference.

**Stats:** Full Electrolytes · Zero Sugar · Actually Tastes Good
*Scribble underline on "actually tastes good"*

---

### Pillar 3: 🥛 PROTEIN
**Kicker:** Phase 03 — Rebuild

**Headline:**
Your muscles did the work.
Give them something worth it.

**Body:**
Here's the thing — your body doesn't grow during the workout. It grows after. So what you put in afterwards kind of matters a lot.

Clean whey isolate. 25g protein. Minimal ingredients. No weird aftertaste that makes you question your life choices. Just protein that does protein things.

**Stats:** 25g Protein · Whey Isolate · No Weird Aftertaste
*Scribble arrow pointing to stats with "that's it. that's the list."*

---

### Pillar 4: 💪 CREATINE
**Kicker:** Phase 04 — Strengthen

**Headline:**
The most researched supplement ever.
(And it actually lives up to it.)

**Body:**
Creatine has been studied more than basically any other supplement in existence. The verdict? It works. More strength. Better recovery. Consistent results over time.

Ours is pure creatine monohydrate — 5g per scoop. No loading phase drama. No fancy proprietary formula with a trademarked name. Just the thing that works.

**Stats:** 5g Creatine Monohydrate · Micronized · Unflavored
*Scribble badge: "science's favorite supplement" with small drawn beaker*

---

### Pillar 5: 🧘 ASHWAGANDHA
**Kicker:** Phase 05 — Reset

**Headline:**
Rest isn't lazy.
It's where the magic happens.

**Body:**
Your body can't rebuild if it's stressed out all the time. Cortisol (the stress hormone) messes with your sleep, your recovery, and honestly your whole vibe.

KSM-66® ashwagandha is the most clinically studied version out there. It helps lower cortisol, improves sleep, and gets your body ready to do it all again tomorrow. Recovery isn't optional — it's the whole point.

**Stats:** KSM-66® · 600mg · Clinically Validated
*Scribble underline on "the whole point" + small drawn moon/stars*

---

## SECTION 3: The Complete Cycle — Bundle Reveal

**Headline:**
The whole system.
(Not five random things in a cart.)

**Subhead:**
Five pillars that actually work together. Energy → Hydration → Protein → Creatine → Recovery → repeat. It's a cycle, not a shopping spree.

Most brands sell you products. We built you a system that makes sense.

**CTA:** Build Your Cycle →

## SECTION 4: Why Enigma (Trust Section)

**Headline:**
What we *don't* put in matters just as much.

*"don't" gets a scribble circle*

**Three Columns:**

**No Proprietary Blends** ✋
Every ingredient. Every dose. Right there on the label. If a brand won't tell you what's inside, that's a red flag, not a feature.

**No Fillers, No Fluff** 🧹
We don't pad formulas to look impressive on the back panel. If an ingredient doesn't have clinical evidence at the dose we use? It doesn't get in.

**No Marketing BS** 🎯
No "1000% of your daily value!!!" headlines. No before/after photos from two different lighting setups. Just real products for people who actually read the label (and people who want to start).

*Scribble checkmarks next to each column header*

---

## SECTION 5: Individual Products

**Section Headline:**
Shop by pillar.
(Or just get the whole cycle. We won't judge.)

*Scribble arrow pointing down to the product grid*

---

## SECTION 6: Brand Story Teaser

**Headline:**
We started Enigma because we were tired of supplements that look great and do nothing.

**Body:**
So we read the research. Dosed everything clinically. Put every single ingredient on the label. Made it taste good. And made the brand actually fun — because taking care of yourself shouldn't feel like homework.

That's it. That's the brand.
