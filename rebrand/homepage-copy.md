### Pillar 1: ⚡ ENERGY
**Kicker:** Phase 01 — Ignite

**Headline:**
The session starts here.

**Body:**
Before the first rep, before the warm-up — your body needs a signal. Not a sugar rush. Not a jittery mess. A clean, focused ignition.

Enigma Pre Workout delivers clinical doses of citrulline, beta-alanine, and caffeine. No proprietary blends. No filler. Just the ingredients that actually work, at the doses that actually matter.

**Product:** Enigma Pre Workout
**Micro-stat:** 6g Citrulline | 3.2g Beta-Alanine | 200mg Caffeine

*Color accent: Warm Orange #F97316*

### Pillar 2: 💧 HYDRATION
**Kicker:** Phase 02 — Sustain

**Headline:**
Water isn't enough.

**Body:**
Halfway through, your muscles are pulling electrolytes faster than water can replace them. Cramping. Fatigue. The wall.

Enigma Hydration replaces what sweat takes — sodium, potassium, magnesium — in a formula that actually tastes like something you'd drink. Zero sugar. Full electrolyte profile. Because performance dies when hydration drops.

**Product:** Enigma Hydration Powder
**Micro-stat:** Full Electrolyte Profile | Zero Sugar | Light Citrus

*Color accent: Cool Blue #3B82F6*

### Pillar 3: 🥛 PROTEIN
**Kicker:** Phase 03 — Rebuild

**Headline:**
The work doesn't end when you rack the weight.

**Body:**
Muscle breakdown happens during the session. Muscle growth happens after. The window matters, and what you put in it matters more.

Enigma Protein is clean whey isolate — 25g protein per serving, minimal ingredients, no bloating, no chalky aftertaste. Just rebuild fuel that your body actually absorbs.

**Product:** Enigma Whey Protein
**Micro-stat:** 25g Protein | Whey Isolate | Minimal Ingredients

*Color accent: Warm Cream #F5D5A0*

### Pillar 4: 💪 CREATINE
**Kicker:** Phase 04 — Strengthen

**Headline:**
The most studied supplement in history. For a reason.

**Body:**
Creatine isn't a trend. It's decades of research pointing to the same conclusion: it works. More power output. Faster recovery between sets. Better performance over time.

Enigma Creatine is pure creatine monohydrate — 5g per serving. No loading phase needed. No fancy formulas. Just the compound that's earned its reputation.

**Product:** Enigma Creatine Monohydrate
**Micro-stat:** 5g Creatine Monohydrate | Micronized | Unflavored

*Color accent: Bold Red #EF4444*

### Pillar 5: 🧘 ASHWAGANDHA
**Kicker:** Phase 05 — Reset

**Headline:**
Growth happens when you rest.

**Body:**
Cortisol is the silent killer of gains. Stress accumulates. Sleep suffers. Recovery stalls. And tomorrow's session pays the price.

Enigma Ashwagandha uses KSM-66® — the most clinically validated ashwagandha extract. It lowers cortisol, improves sleep quality, and helps your body actually recover. So when the alarm goes off, you're ready for Phase 01 again.

**Product:** Enigma Ashwagandha (KSM-66®)
**Micro-stat:** KSM-66® | 600mg | Clinically Validated

*Color accent: Sage Green #6DA37E*

## SECTION 3: The Complete Cycle — Bundle Reveal

**Headline:**

**Subhead:**
Five pillars working together. Not five random supplements — one connected cycle engineered for athletes who train every day.

## SECTION 4: Why Enigma (Trust Section)

*Design: Light background section. Clean grid. Scribble accent circles around numbers.*

**Headline:**
What we don't do matters more.

**Three Columns:**

**No Proprietary Blends**
Every ingredient. Every dose. Printed on the label. If a brand hides behind "proprietary blend," they're hiding something.

**No Fillers, No Fluff**
We don't pad formulas to look impressive. If an ingredient doesn't have clinical evidence at the dose we use, it's not in the product.

**No Marketing Gimmicks**
No "1000% of your daily value" headlines. No before/after scams. Just transparent nutrition for people who actually read the label.

---

## SECTION 5: Individual Products

*Design: Clean product grid. Dark cards on light background. Big product images. Minimal text.*

**Section Headline:**
Shop by pillar.

*Grid of all 5 products with pillar icon, product name, one-line description, price, and "Add to Cart" CTA.*

---

## SECTION 6: The Enigma Standard (Brand Story Teaser)

**Headline:**
Built by athletes. Tested by science. Trusted by people who read labels.

**Body:**
Enigma started because we got tired of supplements that looked impressive and delivered nothing. We read the research. We dosed clinically. We put everything on the label. That's it. That's the brand.
